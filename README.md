# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-with-Python
🔍 Project Workflow – Step by Step:

📥 1. Collected Raw Data from Kaggle
I started by downloading a real-world Diwali sales dataset from Kaggle, which included customer demographics and purchase details.

🗂 2. Extracted and Prepared the Files
Unzipped and organized the dataset to make it ready for analysis.

🐍 3. Installed Python (if not already installed)
Set up Python — the core tool for the project.

📓 4. Installed Jupyter Notebook
Used Jupyter Notebook to write and run my code in an interactive and structured environment.

📦 5. Installed Required Libraries
Installed and imported all necessary libraries:
	•	Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
	•	NumPy for numerical operations
	•	Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization

🧹 6. Cleaned the Data using Pandas
	•	Removed unnecessary columns
	•	Checked for and handled missing values
	•	Formatted and renamed columns for consistency
This step made the dataset clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

📊 7. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With the help of Seaborn and Matplotlib, I created visualizations to analyze:
	•	Spending by Gender
	•	Order count by Age Group
	•	Sales patterns by Occupation
	•	Purchase behavior by Marital Status
	•	Most popular Product Categories
	•	Sales by Product ID
